# Final Project ENEL645



ABSTRACT

This study evaluated threshold-based classification and XGBoost for privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) of homelessness data. The threshold method, combined with Bloom filters and the Dice coefficient, achieved precision up to 85% and accuracy of 82.6% but required significant computational resources, making full-scale implementation challenging. XGBoost, enhanced with feature engineering and ADASYN for class balancing, achieved precision and recall above 0.80, with 72.8% overall accuracy, while being more efficient for larger datasets. Threshold methods are suitable for resource-limited settings, while XGBoost provides robust performance where computational capacity allows. These approaches demonstrate the potential for unifying fragmented homelessness data, improving policy-making and resource allocation while maintaining privacy.
