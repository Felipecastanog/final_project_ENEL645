# Final Project ENEL645

## Abstract
This study evaluated threshold-based classification and XGBoost for privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) of homelessness data. The threshold method, combined with Bloom filters and the Dice coefficient, achieved precision up to 85% and accuracy of 82.6%, but required significant computational resources, making full-scale implementation challenging. XGBoost, enhanced with feature engineering and ADASYN for class balancing, achieved precision and recall above 0.80, with 72.8% overall accuracy, while being more efficient for larger datasets. Threshold methods are suitable for resource-limited settings, while XGBoost provides robust performance where computational capacity allows. These approaches demonstrate the potential for unifying fragmented homelessness data, improving policy-making and resource allocation while maintaining privacy.

## Repository Structure

### **Data**
Contains synthetic datasets used in this study for PPRL experiments.

### **Codes**
Contains codes used for:
- `PrivacyPreserving_and_Threshold.ipynb`: Preprocessing data, applying Bloom filters, and implementing a threshold-based method for 500 subjects.
